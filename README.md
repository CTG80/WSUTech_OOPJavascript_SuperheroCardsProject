Assignment: Filtering and Looping Through Superhero Data
In this assignment, you will practice using for loops and if conditions to filter through an array of superhero data.

Instructions

Use this data for your project


const avengers = ;



Write a for loop that iterates over the entire array and logs each superhero's name to the console.

Write another for loop, inside that loop, write an if condition that checks if the superhero's primary power is "Super Strength". If it is, log the superhero's name to the console.

Write another for loop, inside that loop, write an if condition that checks if the superhero's age is greater than or equal to 50. If it is, log the superhero's name and age to the console.
